# Project Euler Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler problems written in the languages of choice.

## LLM Use
Parts of this project are produced with the advice from Google's Gemini, not Gemini code-assist or CoPilot.
No single piece of code has gone into this project without human eyes reading & understanding every line.

No LLM can effectively type the following:

## My background

I have been doing some programming as a hobby since I was in high school, but never spent significant time in working on any single project.
Figuring out how to do niche topics was always done with extreme frustration since guides exist for everything, but rarely what I am trying to specifically do.
With LLMs becoming readily available study and code review tools, I have chosen to make use of Google's LLM, Gemini, to get extremely specific task advice, and to learn lingo that is often rarely explained in detail, or is locked in manuals or books that either are not readily accessible, or require learning separate languages, programming paradigms, or quarter century old tools, versions, and work flows.

While tried-and-true is great when you are learning from someone specifically, blindly following someone else's guide and repeating every problem they have solved does not significantly develop the programming & problem solving capacity of an entry level developer.
LLMs have given the ability for an entry level developer to get help solving trivial problems, without the work being done for them, at least when used properly.
LLMs have also given the ability for a developer to fail-fast, and interate on a design, and find obvious without specifically knowing how the entire structure should look ahead of time, and get advice on where to take the project going forward.

With many passes, many failures, and many new projects, an entry level developer can learn the paradigms that are often not learned without significant financial or career risk.
